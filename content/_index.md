Hi! I'm a software engineer based in Berlin.

I work across the stack—from systems programming in Rust and C to web development and cloud infrastructure. Currently building things at Meyer Sound.

This is where I write about whatever catches my interest: low-level programming, tooling, projects I'm hacking on, or anything else that seems worth documenting.
